### Vulnerability Description

Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Sourcecodester Online [Covid-19 Directory on Vaccination System](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15244/design-and-implementation-covid-19-directory-vacination.html) v1.0 by Walterjnr1, **allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via the txtfullname parameter or txtphone parameter  to register.php without logging in**.



#### payloadï¼š">\<script>alert(1)\</script>

### POC:

We found that the source program did not check the txtfullname parameter and txtphone parameterfor echo at this location, and there was a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

We execute payload on the /covid-19-vaccination/register.php page.

<img src="images/3.jpg" alt="1" style="zoom:40%;" />

We can see that the system successfully executes the \<script>alert(1)\</script> command of the attacker.
