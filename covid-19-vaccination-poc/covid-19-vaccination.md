### Vulnerability Description

[Covid-19 Directory on Vaccination System v1.0](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15244/design-and-implementation-covid-19-directory-vacination.html)  was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the verification.php.Because the program does not verify the **txtvaccinationID** parameter, it allows us to use this parameter for XSS attacks **without logging in**. The system will accurately store and retrieve information about covid-19 vaccination and it is an open source project on https://www.sourcecodester.com/.



#### payloadï¼š">\<script>alert(1)\</script>

**Browser: Mircosoft Edge**    (Note that in order to properly restore the attack process, the xss filter cannot be enabled on the attacker's browser)



### POC:

We found that the source program did not check the txtvaccinationID for echo at this location, and there was a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

We execute payload on the /covid-19-vaccination/verification.php page.

Attackers can execute any Web script or command with an elaborate payload that injects the txtvaccinationID parameter.

 It is important to note that verification.php is a page for vaccinators to query vaccination result information, **so attackers do not need to log in their accounts to carry out XSS attacks and compromise system security.**

We can see that the system successfully executes the \<script>alert(1)\</script> command of the attacker.
